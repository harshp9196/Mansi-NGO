                    This is what the founder Kokilaben Solanki has to say when asked why she started Mansi. She
                    started this organization with nothing but from gaining the trust of people from slums. She
                    already had some things in her mind about what and how everything she wanted to do. It started
                    with no staff, no funds, no place. It took a whole one year to start with regular daily operations
                    after the opening. Mansi was registered on 08/05/2008 and its activities started on 21/07/2009.
                    Firstly, there was the question of having a place to operate, she rented a place from her elder
                    brother.
                </p>
                <p class="long-copy" style="margin-top: 0.5rem">
                    For the staff members, they started kept family relatives as temporary members of the Ngo. Then
                    after two years, they started planning their budget for activities, salary structure, recruiting,
                    etc.
                    Home Assistant Project being a business entity helped in providing an increase in salaries of the
                    staff. Currently, there are over 150 clients that are taking the Home Assistant Services and are all
                    satisfied with Mansi. The flexible system of Mansi Bachat Mandal also helped in gaining the
                    much-required trust from the people of slums.
                </p>
                <p class="long-copy" style="margin-top: 0.5rem">
                    Kokilaben single-handedly brought the success and the platform for Mansi. She not the woman
                    behind the success of Mansi but also raised a son who is now happily married and has two kids.
                    She has devoted equal time on both sides of her life. She has done a study of slums all over
                    Gujarat. She has done work in the Ahmedabad Riots, Earthquake of Kutch. She herself only
                    being 8 th pass has looked after the education of many other girls and has not only made them
                    graduate but also made them earn a livelihood for themselves. Kokilaben used her resources for
                    over 30 slum kids, took them to Bangalore for training and placed them at Forever Jewelers
                    Ahmedabad. For 3 continuous years, she was invited to the National Foundation, Delhi.
                    Kokilaben is a headstrong woman that works rigorously to find solutions to the problems faced
                    by people in the slums.
