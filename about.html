                    has the total limited staff of 6 members. It started first with gaining the trust of the people of
                    the
                    slums. This was done by visiting them in their homes and understanding them. The founder
                    Kokilaben herself, as well as the staff members, visited the slums even today to understand the
                    grass-root problems of the slums and how can they work on improving the conditions..</p>

                    underprivileged women
                    to be self-independent for working and earning a living for themselves. It is a business entity that
                    acts as a mediator between these women and the clients that want to render services such as
                    household chores, taking care of an infant, etc.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem">
                    There are fixed hours for a woman to work and is paid according to the number of hours and the
                    amount of work that the client makes her do every day. A woman working in Mansi Livelihood
                    Services earns more than a normal ‘Kaamwali Bai’ and also the clients are bound to provide
                    some perks to the women working for them. Home Assistant Program is a registered business
                    entity and Mansi earns profit from it by acting as a mediator. But it also has helped women from
                    the slums to uplift themselves by providing for their families..</p>

                    helping the people
                    from slums to save some of their monthly earnings and understand the importance of saving
                    instead of spending all out. The main aim to start the savings scheme was to remove the system
                    of the slum people taking money from the moneylenders. Mansi identified that the main threat
                    faced by the slums for the loan were moneylenders. Moneylenders, though being a quick source
                    for cash, charged skyrocketed high interests for the loans, due to this the poor have to give most
                    of their monthly earnings for repaying the loans along with the interests..</p>
