                <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem">Mansi Organization in its initial period was started with only 3 female
                    members as staff. It still
                    has the total limited staff of 6 members. It started first with gaining the trust of the people of
                    the
                    slums to invest in the savings program. This was done by making them know that the founder, as
                    well as the staff members, belong to the exact same surrounding area and the NGO is working
                    for their cause i.e., to uplift them from poverty.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem">
                    The main aim to start the savings scheme was to remove the system of the slum people taking
                    money from the moneylenders. Mansi identified that the main threat faced by the slums for the
                    loan were moneylenders. Moneylenders, though being a quick source for cash, charged
                    skyrocketed high interests for the loans, due to this the poor have to give most of their monthly
                    earnings for repaying the loans along with the interests.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem">
                    In the span of around 10 years the organization has earned tremendous success in the all-round
                    development of slum dwellers as well has changed their lives.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem">A place where girls drop out of schools from 7 th Grade just because she
                    no longer wants to go
                    and her parents think that it’s okay! If she drops out, Place where housewives don’t know how to
                    sign on legal papers, a place so deeply stuck in the same old cycle of poverty that getting of it
                    seems impossible. This is the ugly picture of the backstory of the place we call our society.
                    Is this what we want for our city of Ahmedabad?&quot;</p>
