        <div class="row js--wp-1">
            <div class="col span-1-of-1 event-box1">
                <p>According to her family members, she was illiterate, the one who doesn't know anything about the
                    world,
                    she was undervalued, underrated, can be easily fooled.</p>
                <p> Straight from the village she shifted to the city and didn’t know things are done, not even the
                    household chores. But now she is the most efficient of them all.</p>

                <p> Gauriben Ishwarlal Gohel joined Mansi Livelihood Services in the year 2009. Yes, she has been a part
                    of
                    the organization since the start. She is a perfect example of everything Mansi works for i.e.,
                    development and upliftment of the socially and economically backward women. Gauriben when joined the
                    organization was very quiet as a person.</p>

                <p> She couldn't speak her mind and was afraid to express her own
                    opinions. She was suppressed by the patriarchic system. After joining to collect her first two-three
                    salaries she came with her father-in-law. Him being the head came in to collect her salary with her.
                    This is also an example of the deeper layers of patriarchy that run in Indian households.
                    Gauriben may have learned a lot of things after joining Mansi Livelihood Services like cooking,
                    Hindi
                    Language, lightning a gas, etc., but the most important thing she learned she is as capable as the
                    men
                    in her house. </p>
                <p>She can stand on her two feet and be a bread earner in the house. Her father-in-law now
                    trusts the system of Mansi completely and Gauriben has become bold and frank while talking.
                    After her success with Mansi Livelihood Services, she also opened a savings account and started
                    saving
                    money. Gauriben can now take household decisions on her own and there are no questions asked to her
                    as
                    the men know now that her decisions are right and are for the best of everyone's interest.</p>

                The Journey from Fearful to Fearless </p>
        </div>

            <div class="col span-1-of-1 event-box1">
                <p>This is the journey of Jyotiben Shoheliya, who has worked for Mansi Seva Sakhi Mandal for about 6
                    years. It hasn’t been easy for her to open up about her past before joining Mansi. Her journey is
                    the one with an alcoholic husband and a mentally abusive household. Here is her journey where she
                    grew to become a fearless woman.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Had problems in speaking up</li>
                    <li>
                        Wasn’t able to go out more, didn’t know how to travel alone.</li>
                    <li>
                        Had money problems at home.</li>
                    <li> Used to be quite and tolerated all the mental abuses thrown at her</li>
                </ul>

                <p> Moreover, her condition may not have changed much but she has learned to deal with them in a better
                    way rather than to stay quiet about it.</p>
